Quotes dealing with Java that I've found noteworthy

In the [comments to a Spring Integration post found on reddit:](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/1cj6yr/what_the_heck_is_spring_integration_all_about/)
 - "wow hello world with just 72 lines of code"
 - "Awesome.  Now I can create a loop by getting InfiniteObjectIterator from the AbstractInfiniteObjectIteratorFactory"
